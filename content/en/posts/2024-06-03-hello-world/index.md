Having a space you can call your own is really valuable. It is true both in real life, and online. We tend to forget that a lot, and with all the alternatives we have with social media it is something that people just ignore completely. That's *one* of the reasons I have begun this site. A place to call my own.

Last week I was reading "Show your Work" by Austin Kleon, and in page 65 I stumbled upon a quote that seems simple enough, but with something really important to say to all of us who use the internet every day:

> "Carving out a space fo yourself online, somewhere where you can express yourself and share your work, is still one of the best possible investments you can make with your time."  
> \- Andy Baio

It is something deceptively simple, yet, when was the last time you could call something online "your own"? The answer is not really that enticing. With social media to choose from we have forgotten that notion. The internet has become a series of islands where everybody hangs out, but nobody owns more than a name and the hope that the island stays afloat (anybody remember MySpace?).

That's when it hit me. I've been actively avoiding creating my own space hiding behind scope creep and impostor syndrome, but the reality is that any moment and any skill is good enough to share or to create your own space.

As long as you keep going, learning and improving, it is worth doing.
