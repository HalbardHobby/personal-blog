Truth be told, a challenge I have in life is the fact that knowing how to cook, I'm a real sweet tooth. This little detail has taken me into memorable feasts, and in some way without regret since I cooked a lot of the food with ingredients that were already in the kitchen. Fortunately there is an incredibly easy dessert (Related to pudding and creme brulee) able to satisfy that craving for something sweet. It also has the added benefit of having high protein and so, it helps avoid any further cravings.
