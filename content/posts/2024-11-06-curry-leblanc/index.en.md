Something people say about curry is that it is an extremely spicy and hot dish. And while it is true that there are a lot of spices involved, there is no need for it to be hot. That is the case for this japanese style curry that uses a slow cook and some additional fat to better combine flavours, and create a texture that can be accompanied with almost any carb and drink.
